App is used from an android or linux application.
There are two components:
 - chat interface in the app
 - occasional notifications

the chat interface is a typical llm chat bot. The llm has access to a lot of sources about me (described in architecture).
In the app the user sees a current conversation history with user's and bot messages and can type a message into a form and click submit or enter.
When the bot responds with: file views, code snippet, markdown text, urls - then this part of message is formatted accordingly.
In the chat a user may ask the chat bot to perform some action, before doing the action chatbot asks the user for permission providing the description and view into what the action is.
The available actions are:
 - for now just a mock, an action that doesn't do anything but shows some text.

Notifications contain a message generated by the chatbot. Clicking the notification brings the user to the app with the chat already started with the given message and awaiting users answer.
How often and when the notification appears (with degree of randomness) and what is the message (generated by the chat llm based on a prompt with an instruction) - is specified in the applications configuration file.

The usefulness of the app comes from the llm agent having in context a lot of personal autobiographical information.
