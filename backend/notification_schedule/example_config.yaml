# Example notification scheduling configuration
# Each notification has a name and scheduling parameters
#
# Frequency semantics:
# - 0 <= frequency < 1: probabilistic scheduling (random draw to decide if schedule)
# - frequency >= 1: schedule floor or ceil times based on fractional part
#   e.g., 1.5 = 50% chance of 1 schedule, 50% chance of 2 schedules
